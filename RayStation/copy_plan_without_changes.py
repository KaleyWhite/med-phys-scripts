    """Copies the current plan, retaining beam set and isocenter names.
    
    The name of the copy is the name of the old plan plus ' (1)'.
    The comments in the new plan are 'Copy of ___'
    The beam set and beam isocenter names match those of the old plan.
    The beam and setup beam numbers are unique across all cases in the current patient.
    The beam and setup beam names are the same as their numbers. If the old (setup) beam is different from its number, the old name is appended to the new (setup) beam's description.

    Does not switch to the new plan because this would require saving the patient.

    Returns: The new plan.
